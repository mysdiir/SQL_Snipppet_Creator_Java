# SQL_Snipppet_Creator_Java
Java version of my Snippet Creator in PHP and JS

During my studies I had to start a project which included designing a database, create an ERM, create and fill the database with SQL. 
We had a lot of time doing this project and due to little itching in my fingers, I had the idea making a SQL Snippet Creator for lazy people with 
Java.
